# Aadhar-Number-Extraction-using-OCR
This project extracts Aadhar card numbers from an image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract and OpenCV.

## Features
- Extracts valid Aadhar card numbers.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected numbers.
- Saves the processed image with detected numbers highlighted.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

## Output
- The script prints detected Aadhar numbers in the format: `XXXX XXXX XXXX`.
- The [processed image](new.jpg) highlights detected numbers.
